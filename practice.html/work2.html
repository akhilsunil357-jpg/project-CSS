            <h1 style="color: red;">THOR</h1>
            <p>Thor is a powerful and heroic character from Marvel, known as the God of Thunder and the prince of Asgard. Wielding his enchanted hammer Mjölnir, Thor possesses immense strength, the ability to control lightning, and the power to fly. Though he begins his journey as a proud and impulsive warrior, Thor gradually learns humility, responsibility, and the true meaning of leadership. His character combines mythological roots from Norse legends with modern superhero elements, making him both a mighty warrior and a relatable hero. Through his battles to protect Asgard and Earth, Thor proves that true strength comes not only from power, but also from wisdom and compassion.</p>
            <ul style="color: antiquewhite; font-style: italic;">
                <li>“Whosoever holds this hammer, if he be worthy, shall possess the power of Thor.” – The Power of Mjölnir</li>
                <li>“I choose to run towards my problems, and not away from them. That’s what heroes do.” – Thor</li>
                <li>“In the end, the strength of a hero is not in his hammer, but in his heart.”</li>
